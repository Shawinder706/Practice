Document (individual elements combined to form an entire HTML page)


*Doctype: <!DOCTYPE html>
 	Required as the first line of an HTML document (historical artifact).
	
	The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to
	the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.


? Root Element: <html>
	? Follows the "doctype" and wraps around all content on the entire page.



? Head Element: <head>
	? Container for things that do not appear as viewable content (e.g., keywords and
	descriptions that will appear in search results, CSS, character set declarations,
	etc.).



? Character Set: <meta charset="UTF-8">
	? Allows document to use "utf-8" character set, which includes most characters
	from all known human languages (nests within head element).
	 UTF stands for Unicode Transformation Format. The '8' means it uses 8-bit blocks to represent a character.



? Title: <title>
	? Sets the title that appears in browser tab (nests within head element).
	? Also appears as the search result in Google.



? Body: <body>
	? Contains all of the content that will be shown to the viewer.



 Elements (content + opening/closing tags)
	? Block Elements form a visible block on a page (e.g., paragraphs, lists, navigation menus,
	footers, etc.):
	? Paragraph: <p>
	? Divider: <hr>
	? Headings: <h1> through <h6>



o NOTE: As a general rule, try to have only one <h1> tag in your HTML
document, and it should be the biggest text element on the page.



? Generic Container: <div>
	


? Lists (each item within a type of list needs to be identified by the "<li>" tag):
		
		o Ordered Lists (lists that are numbered): <ol>
		o Unordered Lists (lists composed of bullet points: <ul>




? Tables: <table>
	o Table Row: <tr>
		o Table Header (consists of one cell within a row): <th>
		? Should be nested within <thead> under main table (semantics).
		o Table Data (consists of one cell within a row): <td>
		? Should be nested within <tbody> under main table (semantics).
		o Borders can be added by entering <table border="1">, although this is
		discouraged, as CSS should be used for styling.




? Forms (interactive controls to submit information to a web server): 
	<form>
		o Typically contain the "action" (the URL to send form data to) and
		"method" (the type of HTTP request, such as "GET" to receive
		information from the server and "POST" to add information to the serve)
		attributes, e.g.:
		<form action="/my-form-submitting-page" method="POST">
		o Input (used to accept data from the user): <input>



? The operation of <input> depends upon its type attribute. For a
complete list of attributes, view Form Input Types. Examples:
	<input
		? Text (can be used for user names): type="text"
		? Password: type="password"
		? Placeholder (temporary text in input fields; used with
	         "text" and "password" attributes): placeholder="insert-text-here"
	</input>
